Based on the Ray Tracing in One Weekend textbook, and the Raytracing Wikipedia article,
this is a raytracing engine in Java with with antialiasing, child rays and gamma correction. 
Over the next couple months, when I have time, I hope to add material textures, different shapes (triangles + polygons), concurrency functionality and 
a high level interface to allow for users to drop in objects of various textures to a scene.
